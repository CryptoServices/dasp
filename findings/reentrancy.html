		<p> Reentrancy is a vulnerability which allows an execution of a function before the previous execution of it is complete. Renatrancy is a concept in many programming languages which refers to a code that can be executed safely before the previous execution is complete. Basically this function can be executed parallelly without causing harm to the overall state ahcine of the program.
		 The Reentrancy attack, probably the most famous Ethereum vulnerability, surprised everyone when discovered for the first time. It was first unveiled during a multimillion dollar heist which led to a hard fork of Ethereum. Reentrancy occurs when external contract calls are allowed to make new calls to the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. For a function, this means that the contract state may change in the middle of its execution as a result of a call to an untrusted contract or the use of a low level function with an external address.</p>

			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)" target="_blank">The DAO</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A <span class="victim contract">smart contract</span> tracks the balance of a number of external addresses and allows users to retrieve funds with its public <code>withdraw()</code> function.</li>
			<li>A <span class="attacker contract">malicious smart contract</span> uses the <code>withdraw()</code> function to retrieve its entire balance.</li>
			<li>The <span class="victim contract">victim contract</span> executes the <code>call.value(amount)()</code> <strong>low level function</strong> to send the ether to the <span class="attacker contract">malicious contract</span> <strong>before updating the balance of the <span class="attacker contract">malicious contract</span></strong>. 
			<li>The <span class="attacker contract">malicious contract</span> has a payable <code>fallback()</code> function that accepts the funds and then calls back into the <span class="victim contract">victim contract</span>'s <code>withdraw()</code> function.</li>
			<li>This second execution triggers a transfer of funds: remember, the balance of the <span class="attacker contract">malicious contract</span> still hasn't been updated from the first withdrawal. As a result, the  <span class="attacker contract">malicious contract</span> successfully withdraws its entire balance a second time.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Code Example</strong>:</p>

		<p>The following function contains a function vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. When the low level <code>call()</code> function sends ether to the <code>msg.sender</code> address, it becomes vulnerable; if the address is a smart contract, the payment will trigger its fallback function with what's left of the transaction gas:</p>

<pre><code>function withdraw(uint _amount) {
	require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
	msg.sender.call.value(_amount)();
	balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
}</code></pre>
