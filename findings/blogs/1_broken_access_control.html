<h2 id="smart-contract-insecurity----broken-access-control">1. Smart Contract (in)Security -- Broken Access Control</h2>
<p>This blog post is the first of a series that will describe some simple real-world <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp">smart contract</a> security bugs, how they were exploited, the resulting impacts and the corresponding code fixes. The series will cover more than $250M USD in losses directly attributable to smart contract security bugs.</p>
<p><strong>What are smart contracts?</strong> Imagine relatively short, publicly-accessible programs capable of owning large amounts of money and that execute complex transaction logic in an unchangeable and unstoppable fashion on a platform that is rapidly evolving alongside with its tools. Think blockchain 2.0 where transactions invoke code execution. These autonomous programs issue and manage private currencies, implement novel funding systems, tokenize capital assets, enable <a href="https://newalchemy.io/">new business models</a> and even breed digital cats called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/cryptokitty-auction.html">CryptoKitties</a>! There is no imagination required - the fascinating and flourishing world of smart contracts is already here with well over <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">$1B USD of Ethereum changing hands daily</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bugs are bad!</strong> One of the primary challenges limiting the progress of smart contract adoption is security. It is well known that &quot;every program always has one more bug&quot;, and <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/accidents/MCO_report.pdf">some bugs can be catastrophic</a>. In the case of smart contracts, security bugs may exist wherever code behavior diverges from developer intent. This applies to both local low-level behavior through to the global system or social context (like <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp">front-running</a>). Further, sometimes intent is stated and sometimes intent is unstated. Clearly, 'security' is a big, broad umbrella term in this application space.</p>
<p><a href="http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/">Solidity</a> is a new language created specifically for <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>-based smart contracts and has many similarities to JavaScript, Java and C. Contracts are compiled to bytecode, embedded on the blockchain via a special transaction, and ultimately executed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine when stimulated by other transactions. As most security bugs are shockingly simple in retrospect, this blog series will not require deep expertise.</p>
<p><strong>The old is new again.</strong> This particular blog post will specifically cover <strong>broken access control</strong>. While smart contracts provide a <a href="http://dasp.co/#item-2">new context with unique novelties</a>, this is most certainly not a new problem. This topic can be found as item 5 in the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control">2017 Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10</a> list of application security risks. Further, access control topics pervade the <a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEI+CERT+Oracle+Coding+Standard+for+Java">SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java</a> and vulnerabilities map to several Common Weakness Enumerations, <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html">including #284</a>. Smart contracts offer unique challenges related to their public execution environment, unchangeable nature, different stakeholder categories and high logical complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Show me the code.</strong> Consider the Solidity code below excerpted from the actual Parity Multisig Wallet contract intended to manage crypto-currency user accounts. The <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x91efffb9c6cd3a66474688d0a48aa6ecfe515aa5#code">actual deployed code</a>, warts and all, can be found via the public Etherscan block explorer. The first three function declarations (on lines 1, 6 and 16) shown below are key, with a glitch lurking in each. The <code>initWallet()</code> function is part of the initialization process intended to be executed once at contract creation. That function then calls <code>initMultiowned()</code> and <code>initDaylimit()</code> which deal with recording ownership details and transaction limits respectively. The fourth and last function declaration (line 21) shown below is perfectly fine, but might provide you with a small hint for what could go wrong...</p>

}</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>

<p><strong>Bug 1.</strong> The fourth and last function declaration (line 21) shown above includes the <code>onlyOwner</code> <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/contracts.html?highlight=modifier#function-modifiers">modifier</a> which acts as a gatekeeper, restricting the ability to invoke the <code>execute()</code> function to the contract owner. Here we see one of the primary purposes behind modifiers - they support <strong>access control</strong> on a granular per-function basis. Auditors (and hackers) will inspect each and every function for access control weaknesses via missing modifiers. Voila - the <code>initWallet()</code> function should similarly include a gatekeeper modifier that restricts the function execution to only when the contract is uninitialized (e.g. just once). There is no modifier here so the <code>initWallet()</code> function can be called repeatedly, with parameters from later invocations overwriting parameters from prior invocations. These parameters include the (new) address of the contract owner. Yes, ownership can be repeatedly changed! Hmmm...</p>
<p><strong>Bug 2.</strong> Furthermore, contract functions can also be constrained by having different <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/contracts.html?highlight=modifier#visibility-and-getters">visibility</a> modifiers such as <code>internal</code>, <code>external</code>, <code>public</code>, etc. The middle two function declarations (lines 6 and 16) above are part of an initialization scheme internal to the contract itself and so should be marked as <code>internal</code> which limits external accessibility. However, the visibility modifier is not specified here so it defaults to <code>public</code>. Yes, these functions can be called by anyone! Hmmm...</p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong> An attacker called the <code>initWallet()</code> function shown above, transferred ownership to themselves and set a high day (transaction) limit. Etherscan clearly shows <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xff261a49c61861884d0509dac46ed67577a7d48cb73c2f51f149c0bf96b29660">this transaction here</a>. Next, the attacker called the <code>execute()</code> function, now as the contract owner, to transfer Ethereum out of the contract and into their own account. Etherscan clearly shows this <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32">series of transactions here</a>, where individual transactions are at the bottom of the page and an account balance of $30M USD is shown near the top. Soon after this, two white-hat teams quickly stepped in to preemptively drain other accounts containing over $200M USD for subsequent return to the rightful owners.</p>
<p><strong>Let's fix it.</strong> The key issue boils down to an initialization function able to set ownership and that can unfortunately be called repeatedly by anyone. The visibility issue on the other two functions is related but ancillary - remember &quot;there is always one more bug&quot;. The corresponding fixes are not overly complicated and the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity/commit/b640df8fbb964da7538eef268dffc125b081a82f">actual GitHub edits</a> are shown below. Lines prefixed with '--' have been removed from the contract code while those prefixed with '+' have been added. There are 4 parts to this fix.</p>

+  modifier only_uninitialized { if (m_numOwners &gt; 0) throw; _; }

-  function initWallet(address[] _owners, uint _required, uint _daylimit) {
+  function initWallet(address[] _owners, uint _required, uint _daylimit) only_uninitialized {

-  function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {
+  function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) internal {

-  function initDaylimit(uint _limit) {
+  function initDaylimit(uint _limit) internal {</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>

<p><strong>Simple in retrospect?</strong> First, a modifier named <code>only_uninitialized</code> is created on line 2 for subsequent use as a gatekeeper - it prevents execution by throwing an exception when the contract has already been initialized. Second, this modifier is applied to the <code>initWallet()</code> function on line 5 so that initialization can only be performed once. Finally, the <code>initMultiowned()</code> and <code>initDaylimit()</code> functions are marked with internal visibility on lines 8 and 11 so they cannot be called from outside the contract.</p>
<p><strong>Not so simple.</strong> The Parity Multisig Wallet was very carefully and methodically developed in the open with many, many expert eyeballs on it. A large part of the original motivation for developing it was to mitigate some of the risks associated with holding crypto-currencies. While the bug may look simple in retrospect, it still fell through the cracks and it wasn't the last bug. In this instance, it all boils down to broken access control in some novel circumstances. The lesson is to very carefully inspect function modifiers and function visibility for lurking weaknesses in access control.</p>
<p>Our running total now stands at $30M USD. Stay tuned, as there is always one more bug!</p>
