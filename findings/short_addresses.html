		<p>Short address attacks are a side-effect of the EVM itself accepting incorrectly padded arguments. Attackers can exploit this by using specially-crafted addresses to make poorly coded clients encode arguments incorrectly before including them in transactions. Is this an EVM issue or a client issue? Should it be fixed in smart contracts instead? While everyone has a different opinion, the fact is that a great deal of ether could be directly impacted by this issue. While this vulnerability has yet to be exploited in the wild, it is a good demonstration of problems arising from the interaction between clients and the Ethereum blockchain. Other off-chain issues exist: an important one is the Ethereum ecosystem's deep trust in specific javascript front ends, browser plugins and public nodes. An infamous off-chain exploit was used in <a href="https://medium.com/crypt-bytes-tech/ico-hack-coindash-ed-dd336a4f1052">the hack of the Coindash ICO</a> that modified the company's Ethereum address on their webpage to trick participants into sending ethers to the attacker's address.</p>

		<!-- example scenario -->
		<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>An exchange API has a trading function that takes a recipient address and an amount.</li>
			<li>The API then interacts with the smart contract <code>transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount)</code> function with padded arguments: it prepends the address (of an expected 20-byte length) with 12 zero bytes to make it 32-byte long</li>
			<li>Bob (<code>0x3bdde1e9fbaef2579dd63e2abbf0be445ab93f<strong>00</strong></code>) asks Alice to transfer him 20 tokens. He maliciously gives her his address truncated to remove the trailing zeroes.</li>
			<li>Alice uses the exchange API with the shorter 19-byte address of Bob (<code>0x3bdde1e9fbaef2579dd63e2abbf0be445ab93f</code>).</li>
			<li>The API pads the address with 12 zero bytes, making it 31 bytes instead of the 32 bytes. Effectively stealing one byte from the following <code>_amount</code> argument.</li>
			<li>Eventually, the EVM executing the smart contract's code will remark that the data is not properly padded and will add the missing byte at the end of the <code>_amount</code> argument. Effectively transfering 256 times more tokens than thought.</li>
